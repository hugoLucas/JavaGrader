# JavaGrader
Grade student Java files with Python. System is currently only able to perform two types of tests: simple tests where the user specifies the input to the program and expected output, and file tests where the user specifies the file to compile along with the student files and the input files performs the actual testing. In the case of the former, a student fails a test if the Python program passes along an input and does not detect the expected output in the program file output. In the latter case, a program only fails if the input file outputs a FAIL statement.
